gem5 CPU simulations and testing 


Lab experiments for the class "Advanced Computer Architecture" examining the performance of CPUs with different L1 and L2 cache configurations. Number of cores, clock speed, cache associativity, cache line size and total cache size are explored and evaluated on their power efficiency, cache miss rate and performance.
